       <h2 class="subheader">About Me</h2>
       
       <p>Iâ€™m Praman White, a dedicated professional with a background in logistics, customer service, and technology</p>
       
       <p>My career began in the retail industry, where I developed skills in operations, team management, and customer service.</p>
       
       <p>As an E-Commerce Logistics Supervisor at Fred Meyer and a Head Cashier at Home Depot, I learned the importance of ownership, initiative, and relationship building.</p>
       
       <p>Originally from Thailand, I moved to the Greater Seattle Area in 2002, and over the years, I have been actively involved in my community.</p>
           
      <p>Volunteering with special needs students and captaining my high school's varsity bowling team helped shape my values and commitment to inclusivity and resilience. Currently, I am enrolled in the Year Up United program's Application Development Track, building my coding skills and working toward an internship in tech. I aim to combine my experience in logistics and customer service with my technical training to make a meaningful impact in the technology field. Driven by curiosity and a passion for growth, I strive to contribute innovative ideas and solutions wherever I go.</p>
